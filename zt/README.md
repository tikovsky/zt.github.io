## Details

1. Only supports .yo code
2. Using Angular + Angular-route
3. move.js for CSS3 animations
4. Implemented a simple CommonJS module loader and a canvas CPI curve graph plotter

## Notes

1. All dependencies are included. So I can use `gh-pages` as the main branch.
2. To open it locally, please host the static files under a HTTP server. The `file://` protocol won't work.
